Gardening and farming skills are best placed under Crafting or Survival, depending on your system’s focus:
	•	If your Crafting category includes all forms of creating, producing, and managing resources (like blacksmithing, alchemy, and cooking), then gardening and farming fit naturally here as they involve growing, harvesting, and managing crops and plants.
	•	If your Survival category emphasizes self-sufficiency, living off the land, and resource gathering, gardening and farming can also fit here, especially if you want to highlight skills like foraging, food production, and sustainable living.
Some games and guides group gardening and farming with both crafting (for the production aspect) and survival (for the self-sufficiency aspect). For maximum clarity and minimal overlap, choose the category that best matches how you want players to use these skills in your game. If gardening and farming are about producing goods and managing resources, put them in Crafting. If they’re about staying alive and self-sufficiency, use Survival.

Great observation! To further clarify and separate “Crafting” and “Expression” so that art and smithing are not grouped together, you can divide them into more precise, non-overlapping categories:
