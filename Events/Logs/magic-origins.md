# Magic Origins

## Origin of Magic
Magic is the power of inputting a certain amount and type of mana and outputting it as a spell. Magic is based on 8 basic elements: earth, water, air, fire, light, dark, space, and time. Simple spells are cast with just one element, but higher difficulty spells are multi elemental.

According to ancient legends:
When the realm was originally formed, the Gods born *8 Original Spirits* to lay claim to the *8 True Elements* that were used for the realms creation. There was __Terros the Great March__, __Aquos the Low Tide__, __Galos the Raging Breath__, __Ignios the Dragon Ancestor__, __Luxos the Purecrown__, __Oblos the Nightwalker__, __Banos the Hidden Expanse__, and __Horos the First Watcher__.

__Terros the Great March__ was a bull spirit. His given domain ranged from the top of mountains to the deepest of caves. His constant forming and crushing led to the land we know today. Thus, Earth Magic was formed.

__Aquos the Low Tide__ was a whale spirit. Her protecting of the raging seas led to the vast life and vibrant ocean we know today. Thus, Water Magic was given.

__Galos the Raging Breath__ was a hawk spirit. Her patrol of the skies brought upon the immerse sky we know today. Thus, Air Magic was created.

__Ignios the Dragon Ancestor__ was a lizard spirit. His resting within the hottest layers of the land led to the passionate flames we know today. Thus, Fire Magic was forged.

__Luxos the Purecrown__ was a deer spirit. His care of the great forests let multitudes of ecosystems flourish. Thus, Light Magic was passed.

__Oblos the Nightwalker__ was a wolf spirit. His lurking within the shadowy realms allowed for the day and night be so distinguished. Thus, Dark Magic was risen.

__Banos the Hidden Expanse__ was a worm spirit. His claim of the vast depths of the underground gave origination to the deepest caverns explored today. Thus, Space Magic was found.

__Horos the First Watcher__ was a spider spirit. Her gaze upon all the world's paths kept our time normal. Without this watching, our time would least to exist. Thus, Time Magic was known.

The magic known today is derived from this story.
