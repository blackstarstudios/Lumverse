The Beginning was Here, and The End was There.

Here, The Beginning chose to bring about a bright and pure existence. He created a vast world with smooth mounts and soft airs. Golden bodies that run under ivory arches. He thought of pure entities and allowed them to inherit the world, spreading amongst themselves. He proclaimed the world as Bahhana, the First Realm of The Almighty. He then covered it with the Supreme One's Seal, bathing it in eternality.

### Chapter 5: Prayers of the Spirits
The Beginning then sought to create a secondary existence. He made a particular world with undefined edges yet open skies. He divided his work into groups. He thought of shapeless beings and gave them the world as their origin. He claimed the world as Teorlan, the Second Realm of Spirits. He then placed in it an Original Being, worthy of His love.

He then gave it to his lesser selves.

### Chapter 7: The Mortal Realm
Where They meet, both touched and brought about an empty space. The Beginning shed it light, and The End took it away. The Beginning started it with wide skies, and The End drowned it in never ending waves. The Beginning filled it with high reaching mountains and lush lands, and The End carved it, making deep cracks in its surface, dark and devoid of His Light. The Beginning brought into it souls of balance, and The End spawned carnivorous souls. It was deemed Estea, the Middle Realm of Mortals, which They saw as good.

### Chapter 8: The Forsakened
The End needed an isolated and container of an existence. She made an unformed world with no edge and no end. She banished undesirable things to its plane. She denoted the world as Jathal, the Fourth Realm of The Forsaken. She then commanded Her lessers to watch.

The End made another existence. She saw nothing and made nothing. She titled the world was Ulrith, the Fifth Realm of The Lost. She then removed it from her presence.

### Chapter 10: Hell Dwelleth on Sin
There, The End wanted a dark and blighted existence. She formed a deep world voided of light and purity. She birthed calamitous beings that took the world and ravaged it. She said the world was Shogrinn, the Last Realm of The Astrayed. She then released the Mark of The End, blacking it from annihilation.

Thus, the Great Realms were formed.
