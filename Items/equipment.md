Tips for Your Game
Group by function/use (e.g., "Tools" for anything that enables a skill or task).

Create subcategories for large groups (e.g., "Kits" under "Tools").

Keep categories broad for easy reference, but detailed enough to cover unique items.

Consider mechanical impact: If an item is only flavor, it might go in a "Miscellaneous" or "Personal Effects" group.
